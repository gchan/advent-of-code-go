# Advent of Code Solutions (in Go)

[My](https://github.com/gchan/) solutions to the programming puzzles on [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

After solving all the puzzles in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (my solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/gchan/advent-of-code-ruby)), I thought it would be neat to solve the puzzles in another programming language. So I decided redo the puzzles in [Go](https://golang.org/), a language I just started to learn!

This is my first attempt at coding in Go, any feedback is appreciated. For the purpose of learning, I may explore and use functionality that might be unnecessary/sub-optimal for the purposes of solving the puzzle.

### What is Advent of Code?

_"Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."_
